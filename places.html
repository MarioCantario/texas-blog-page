            <h3>Austin</h3>
            <p>My adventure started in Austin. My first impression was that the city was full of life and everyone had a great vibe.
              I skipped the expensive restaurants and went straight for the city's famous food trucks. For just a few dollars, I had the best tacos of my life from a small, colorful truck. Sitting on a bench in the sun with a soda and a perfect taco was the best way to start my trip. 
              It really showed that great food doesn't have to be expensive.

            <h3>Austin - Music stop</h3>
            <p>You can't go to Austin and not hear the music. The motto of Austin is the "Live Music Capital of the world" and i totally understand why. 
            Every night, I'd walk down 6th Street and hear music from every bar. I found a small honky-tonk off the main street, ordered a local beer, and just listened to an incredible band.
            The vibe was amazing and I had a good time.
